This project has come to fruition by the need to utilize a touchscreen that I already own so I can use it on my Raspberry Pi 4b as a KlipperScreen for my 3d printer.

This repo will serve as a place for documentation for the progress as well as source.

The screen was originally purchased as Osoyoo Display Monitor with Transparent Case for Raspberry Pi 3b.
The website below indicates no source available as well as claiming that it only works with their provided images.

When I first purchased the screen, I reached out to a contact on the Amazon listing I purchased it from.  They were able to provide me with a diff of their source.  I have not tested this yet but it seems promising at first glance.
